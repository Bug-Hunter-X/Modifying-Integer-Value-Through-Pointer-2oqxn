# Modifying Integer Value Through Pointer
This repository demonstrates a simple C program that modifies the value of an integer variable using a pointer. The code also includes a corrected version and an explanation of the potential issue.

## Bug
The original `bug.c` file contains a seemingly straightforward C code snippet that attempts to modify an integer variable using a pointer. However, a subtle error may cause unexpected behavior in certain scenarios.
